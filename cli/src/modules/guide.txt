---

# network <identifier>

Configures current network type.  The <identifier> is the name of the network.

The <identifier> can be 'mainnet', 'testnet' (which defaults to 'testnet-10'), or 'testnet-11'.

# server <address>

Configures the target RPC server. If the <address> value is an IP of a fully-qualified domain
name, the port will be configured based on the `network` setting.

#

Both network and server values are stored in the application settings and are 
used when running a local node or connecting to a remote node.

#[desktop] node start

Starts the locak Kaspa node instance (available on desktop only)

#[desktop] node mute

Toggle mute of the local Kaspa logs

#[desktop] node status

Display current node status

#[desktop] node select

Allows you to select a different node binary (useful when you need to switch between 
debug and release version of Kaspad)

# connect <address>

Connects the application RPC to the destination address. If the address is omitted, 
the address pre-configured with the 'server' command is used.

# create wallet [<name>]

Creates a local encrypted wallet by generating a private key mnemonic for recovery at a later date.
Once the wallet is created, a default HD Wallet account is created within this wallet.

The <name> argument is optional (the default wallet name is "kaspa") and allows you to create multiple 
named wallets.  Only one wallet can be opened at a time. Keep in mind that a wallet can have multiple
accounts, as such you only need one wallet, unless, for example, you want to separate wallets for 
personal and business needs.

A wallet is encrypted but can also have a payment password. The payment password is also used as a 
mnemonic keyphrase; If you choose to have the payment password, it is permanently bound to your 
mnemonic and will be required if you are recovering you account from mnemonic.

# open [<name>]

Opens an existing wallet. The <name> argument is optional. If the name is omitted, the default "kaspa" wallet is opened.

# create account [<account-type>]

Allows creation of additional HD Wallet accounts within the currently opened wallet.

# delete account

# delete wallet

TODO | Deletes the current wallet from the system.

# list

Lists all accounts in the current wallet.

# select

account is selected, you will be prompted to select an account.  If the wallet contains a single account, it is 
automatically selected.

# send

# history

# import <import-type>

# export <export-type>

#[desktop] miner start
