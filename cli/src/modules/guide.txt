(under development, this will be refactored shortly)

To configure node connectivity you can use the following commands:

`network <identifier>` where the identifier is the name of the network 
                       the values can be: mainnet, testnet or testnet-11
`server <address>`     where the address can be an IP address of the 
                       node you intend to connect to.

Both network and server are stored in the application settings and are 
used when running a local node or connecting to a remove node.

`node start`           starts the local Kaspa node instance (desktop only)
`node mute`            toggle mute of the Kaspad logs
`connect <address>`    will connect the application RPC to the node. If the
                       address is omitted, the pre-configured address is used.
